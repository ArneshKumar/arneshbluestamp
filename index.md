# Gesture Controlled Car With Accelerometer
This project is to be able to control a robot by making gestures with our hands. The main part of this project is to be able to make a robot and have that robot sense what he have on our hand and the robot is able to move around based on hand movements.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Bluetooth Module Pairing
  

My first milestone was pairing two bluetooth modules together and being able to allow one bluetooth module to gather and receive data from the other bluetooth module through serial communication. I connected my Arduino UNO to the breadboard using jumper wires to connect to the bluetooth module and used resistors to divide current, where I connected RXD and TXD to digital pins 2 and 3 respectively. I also had my Arduino MICRO on the breadboard and used the same connections I made with the Arduino UNO, except I directly connected to TX and RX pins, instead of digital pins 2 and 3. The main problem I came across with was that I was able to make my AT commands work with the Arduino UNO but the AT commands would not work with my Arduino Micro. I had to talk with my instructor and we were able to solve the problem by receiving a new pair of bluetooth modules that were able to work through AT commands with both the Arduino UNO and Arduino MICRO. After connecting both the bluetooth modules, I was able to run the Serial Monitor on one COM port and allow one bluetooth module to gather and receive data from the Serial Monitor on the other COM port.
